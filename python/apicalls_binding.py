"""
This example uses the SDK's lower level binding module to access the Splunk REST API.
The binding module handles authentication details (and some additional book-
keeping details not demonstrated by this sample) and the result is a much
simplified interaction with Splunk

The example happens to retrieve a list of installed apps from a given
Splunk instance, but they could apply as easily to any other area of the REST
API.
