# Overview of custom alert actions

Custom alert actions are user-defined alert actions that allow you to extend the Splunk platform with specialized alerting functionality. If your use case requires an alert response that is not natively supported by Splunk software, you can implement this response in a Python script and package the solution in a Splunk app.

For example, say you want to respond to an alert trigger with a customized log message. You can create a custom alert action to write this message to a specified log file when the alert is triggered by a saved search in Splunk Cloud Platform or Splunk Enterprise.

Here are some use cases for custom alert actions.

- You want to send a customized notification to users following a change in data.
